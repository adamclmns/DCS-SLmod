Val Rules!
- Table format is only accepted if indexed by number
- Any default nil value must be a string 'nil'. When slmod loads the table a value of nil is automatically erased by lua and the entry wouldn't be added to the default setting. 

Nest Rules:

-- Vote mission settings

3 types of voting exist:
1. majority : this is the simple majority wins a vote
    Example: 5 Vote for A, 3 Vote for B, and 6 vote for C: C wins
2. magic : short for magic number, this means a required minimum number of votes are needed to change the mission
    Example 1: val set to 5, A gets 4, B gets 5, C gets 3: B wins
    Example 2: val set to 6, A gets 4, B gets 5, C gets 3: Vote fails
3. ratio : A set ratio of the players on the server need to vote for a mission.
    Example 1: val set to 0.6 (60%). 20 players on server. A gets 14, B gets 5: A Wins
    Example 2: val set to 0.6 (60%). 10 players on server. A gets 2, B gets 7: B Wins
